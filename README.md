# Face Dimmer

An app that turns down the brightness of your laptop when your not looking at it. 

The thing is that he cannot identify if is you or anyone else that is looking for now =/ I'm so sorry (no I'm not).

Maybe one day it will become an app. Maybe I will add an option for locking your computer? I don't know man this is just fun!!!11!1
